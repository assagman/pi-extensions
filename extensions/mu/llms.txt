# Mu — Output Condensation Extension

Condenses tool call/result output in Pi transcript while preserving full outputs for LLM context. Overrides builtin tools (bash, read, write, edit, grep, find, ls) with minimal CLI-style summaries. Redacts non-builtin tool results. Provides on-demand result viewer.

## Architecture

"Condense-and-Persist" strategy with two state layers: in-memory (200 results) and session persistence (custom entries). Context hook swaps summaries back to full content for LLM. Pulsing tool line animation at 20 FPS. Result viewer via `/mu-tools` command.
