# Theta — Code Review Extension

Interactive code review extension with 3-column TUI dashboard for browsing git diffs: commits (20%), files (20%), diff (60%). Dynamic commit loading (50 per batch), auto-detects uncommitted changes.

## Architecture

Dashboard class implements Pi's `Component` interface. DiffService wraps git operations via `child_process.exec`. Uses `@pierre/diffs` for structured diff parsing. Vim-style navigation (h/l panels, j/k scroll).
