# pi-extensions

> Monorepo of TypeScript extensions for the Pi coding agent. Extensions enhance Pi with persistent memory, task management, output condensation, questionnaire UI, step looping, and code review capabilities.

This repository contains six Pi coding agent extensions plus shared libraries, built with TypeScript/ESM. Each extension follows a standard structure with src/, docs/, dist/, install.sh, and uninstall.sh.

## Extensions

- [ask](extensions/ask/docs/README.md): Better questionnaire tool — number keys, C-n/C-p nav, proper long text wrapping, always-present "Type something" option
- [delta](extensions/delta/docs/README.md): Persistent memory with SQLite-backed KV storage, episodic events, project notes, and memory index
- [epsilon](extensions/epsilon/docs/README.md): Task management with SQLite-backed tasks, subtasks, priorities, statuses, and tags
- [mu](extensions/mu/docs/README.md): Condenses tool call/result output in Pi transcript while preserving full outputs for LLM context
- [omega](extensions/omega/docs/README.md): Generic step looper — repeat user-defined steps with aggressive compaction
- [theta](extensions/theta/docs/README.md): Code review extension with 3-column TUI dashboard (commits, files, diff)

## Shared Libraries

- shared/core: Repo identification, SQLite helpers, tool factory utilities
- shared/tui: Dimmed overlays and shared TUI components

## Documentation

- [README](README.md): Repository overview and installation instructions
- [AGENTS](AGENTS.md): Instructions for AI coding agents working on this codebase
